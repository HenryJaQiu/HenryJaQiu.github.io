一些对随着时代变化的人物观察。



**引言**

时常有一种感觉，就是在过去某一个瞬间了解的人，尤其是通过文字认识的，在很久以后再次出现在视野中，但已完全不再是旧时模样。

这件事情很有趣，也很无奈，在此聊作记录。



**一些**

2010年，咪蒙在《独唱团》上发表了《好疼的金圣叹》，文笔幽默犀利，还带有一丝南美文学的荒诞。当时草根文学创作和公众知识分子还是民间力量的正面代表。



2012年，曾博在知乎写了一篇很不错的数学文章《[矩阵的秩与行列式的几何意义](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/19609459)》。当时知乎还没有开放邀请，大家都在讨论学术和社科问题。



2016年，黄峥在自己的微信公众号上讨论劣币驱逐良币的现象，与市场自我净化的能力。当时淘宝正在转型，视京东为最大对手。

> Come gather 'round people
> Wherever you roam
> And admit that the waters
> Around you have grown
> And accept it that soon
> You'll be drenched to the bone
>
> If your time to you is worth savin'
> Then you better start swimmin'
> Or you'll sink like a stone
> For the times they are a-changin'

> Come writers and critics
> Who prophesize with your pen
> And keep your eyes wide
> The chance won't come again
> And don't speak too soon
>
> For the wheel's still in spin
> And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
> For the loser now
> Will be later to win
> For the times they are a-changin'

> Come senators, congressmen
> Please heed the call
> Don't stand in the doorway
> Don't block up the hall
> For he that gets hurt
>
> Will be he who has stalled
> The battle outside ragin'
> Will soon shake your windows
> And rattle your walls
> For the times they are a-changin'
>
> 
>
> Come mothers and fathers
> Throughout the land
> And don't criticize
> What you can't understand
>
> Your sons and your daughters
> Are beyond your command
> Your old road is rapidly agin'
> Please get out of the new one
> If you can't lend your hand
> For the times they are a-changin'
>
> 
>
> The line it is drawn
> The curse it is cast
> The slow one now
> Will later be fast
> As the present now
> Will later be past
> The order is rapidly fadin'
> And the first one now
> Will later be last
> For the times they are a-changin'
