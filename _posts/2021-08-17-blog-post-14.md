During past few years, I have attended the application of several research funds, and trying to record some principle tips here. This post could get updated during my academic career continues (if so).

最近看了较为著名的亚马逊的领导力原则，在业界影响力也很广泛，被普遍认为有较高的价值。基于此做了一下中文版本的笔记，以翻译为主，个人理解为辅。



原始内容来自 [Amazon - Leadership Principles](http://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles)



**开篇**

> We hold ourselves and each other accountable for demonstrating the Leadership Principles through our actions every day. Our Leadership Principles describe how Amazon does business, how leaders lead, and how we keep the customer at the center of our decisions. Our unique Amazon culture, described by our Leadership Principles, helps us relentlessly pursue our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company, best employer, and safest place to work.

我们要求自己和彼此通过每天的行动来展示领导原则。我们的领导原则描述了亚马逊如何开展业务，领导者如何领导，以及我们如何让客户成为我们决策的中心。我们独特的亚马逊文化，由我们的领导原则描述，帮助我们不懈地追求我们的使命，成为地球上最以客户为中心的公司、最佳雇主和最安全的工作场所。

- 公文，没有太多参考价值或者我目前理解不了其中的价值



> **Customer Obsession**
> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

**顾客为重** 

领导者从客户开始，然后反向工作。他们努力工作以赢得并保持客户的信任。虽然领导者关注竞争对手，但他们对客户着重关注。

- 强调客户的优先级与工作流程应该是自底向上的。



> **Leaders are owners**
>
> They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

**领导者是主人**

他们着眼长远，不会为了短期结果而牺牲长期价值。他们不仅代表自己的团队，还代表整个公司。他们从不说“那不是我的工作。”

- 强调长期责任与担当



> **Invent and Simplify**
> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

**发明和简化**

领导者期望并要求他们的团队进行创新和发明，并总能找到简化的方法。他们有外部意识，到处寻找新想法，不受“不是在这里发明的”的限制。当我们做新事情时，我们承认我们可能会被误解很长一段时间。

- 强调创新与不拘泥于造轮子



> **Are Right, A Lot**
> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**你是对的，很多**

领导者是对的。他们有很强的判断力和良好的直觉。他们寻求不同的观点，努力坚定自己的信念。

- 强调了坚持正确判断，但是错了怎么办呢？



> **Learn and Be Curious**
> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**学习并保持好奇心**

领导者从不停止学习，总是寻求自我提升。他们对新的可能性感到好奇，并采取行动加以探索。

- 保持学习，不管是不是作为领导都很重要



> **Hire and Develop the Best**
> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

**雇佣和发展最好的人才**

领导者在每次招聘和晋升时都会提高绩效标准。他们认可杰出的人才，并愿意在整个组织中调动他们。领导者培养领导者，并认真对待他们在指导他人方面的角色。我们代表我们所有人发明个人职业发展机制，比如事业选择等。

- 强调雇佣最好的人并给足够的发展机会，作为职员也应当注重后者



> **Insist on the Highest Standard**
> Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

**坚持最高标准**

领导者的标准一直很高，许多人可能会认为这些标准太高了。领导者不断提高标准，推动团队提供高质量的产品、服务和流程。领导者确保缺陷不会被发送到生产线，并且问题得到了解决，所以他们会保持不变。

- 强调高标准，但如何保证这不和短期或者长期利益不冲突？



> **Think Big**
> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**胸怀大志**

目标短浅是一个自我满足的假象。领导者创造并传达一个大胆的方向，激发成果。他们的想法与众不同，并四处寻找为客户服务的方法。

- 强调目标远大并且无所不为。



> **Bias for Action**
> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**侧重行动**

速度在商业中很重要。许多决定和行动是可逆的，不需要广泛研究。我们重视有计划的冒险。

- 敏捷开发，快速迭代，快速反应



> **Frugality**
> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

**节俭**

用更少的时间完成更多的事情。约束孕育着足智多谋、自给自足和创新。增加员工人数、预算规模或固定费用应尽量避免。

- 节约，但很多时候这对事业不利



> **Earn Trust**
> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

**赢得信任**

领导者倾听，坦诚相见，尊重他人。他们在口头上自我批评，即使这样做很尴尬或尴尬。领导者不相信他们或他们团队的体味有香水味。他们将自己和团队与最优秀的团队进行对比。

- 内部信任，团队凝聚



> **Dive Deep**
> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

**深潜**

领导者在各个层面上运作，与细节保持联系，经常进行审计，并且在指标和轶事不同时持怀疑态度。没有任务比他们低。

- 要了解底层业务逻辑，避免误导和误判，避免自大



> **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**
> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

**有骨气；拒绝；承诺**

领导者有义务在他们不同意的情况下，尊重地挑战决策，即使这样做让人不舒服或筋疲力尽。领导者们有信念，也很顽强。他们不会为了社会凝聚力而妥协。一旦决定了，他们就会全力以赴。 

- 该说‘不’的时候要说，但是一定要深思



> **Deliver Result**
> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

交付结果

领导者关注其业务的关键投入，并以正确的质量和及时的方式提供这些投入。尽管遭遇挫折，他们仍能应付自如，永不停息。

- 扛住外部资源需求的压力，为团队维持资源供给



> **Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer**
> Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

**努力成为地球上最好的雇主**

领导者每天都在努力创造一个更安全、更高效、更高效、更多样化、更公正的工作环境。他们以同理心领导，在工作中获得乐趣，并使他人更容易获得乐趣。领导者问自己：我的同事们在成长吗？他们有权力吗？他们准备好迎接下一步了吗？无论是在亚马逊还是其他地方，领导者都对员工的个人成功抱有愿景和承诺。

- 确保员工工作的乐趣与成长



> **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility**
> We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

**成功和规模带来广泛的责任**

我们从车库开始，但现在已经不在了。我们是大的，我们影响着世界，我们远非完美。我们必须谦虚和深思熟虑，即使是我们行为的次要影响。我们的当地社区、地球和子孙后代需要我们每天变得更好。我们必须以一种决心开始每一天，为我们的客户、我们的员工、我们的合作伙伴和整个世界做得更好，做得更好。我们必须结束每一天，知道明天我们可以做得更多。领导者创造的比他们消费的多，并且总是比他们发现的更好。

- 能力越大，责任越大
