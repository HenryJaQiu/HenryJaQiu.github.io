**赛博朋克2077发售日体验**
四天时间一口气打完，字幕出来的时候的感受就像当时看《银翼杀手》一样，虽然还有很多悬念未解，但是管中窥豹已足够感动。后续又补上了全部三条主线结局。

主线中荒坂一家的故事让我想到了EVA的碇真嗣，日本文化中的父子主仆关系向来是文艺作品中最喜欢用来表现人的自我否定的承载物。

平民阶层对公司的仇恨与BR2049异曲同工，接下来不禁对更多的大公司故事有更高的期待，例如康陶工业和生物科技的发家史。

V和银手的纠葛简直就是“2GhostInShell”，双倍攻壳，进一步具像化了押井守当时对灵壳关系和义体化的探讨。

夜之城立体化程度很高，赛博设定下信息的过度饱和展示得非常明显，主机党建议等下一世代光追实装再玩。视觉风格很棒，完全符合设定，可以看截图。

支线和主线的科技落差非常大，毕竟开发成本受限，但也歪打正着了“高科技低生活”这一基础设定，也许这就是其他几个大公司没有戏份的原因？此处继续鞭尸电子羊中的泰瑞尔公司。

数值和战斗系统处理得不错，不会像UBI那样过度rpg化，自由度很高。义体化除了眼手以外，操作起来没有太多新奇感，但确实很帅。断肢系统沿用了巫师三的算法，略落后于其他战斗体验。

零零碎碎的BUG遇到不少，但是忍一忍都能继续玩。游戏本身的细节做得还是很足，例如路人玩平板的交互手势，配角开车时对方向盘的控制等都很合理，还有那么多分支选择，由此导致工作量巨大，来不及修bug也很正常。

有很多科幻侧的彩蛋，比如死亡搁浅的BB，银翼杀手的tearsinrain等等，没有骑士五德的湖中剑跑车真贵。

这一作该有的东西差不多都有了，剩下来的就等补丁和DLC。虽然这作已经稳占千万级的销量，但是CDPR现在这样靠大量透支劳动力，信用和口碑，五六年磨一剑的商业模式还是真的很让人担心会说散就散。所以多出点DLC卖钱吧！



**Cyberpunk 2077 release day experience**
After four days of typing in one breath, the feeling when the subtitles came out was like watching "Blade Runner" at the time. Although there are still many suspenses left unsolved, Gyeopiao in the tube is moved enough. Later, all three main line endings were added.

The story of the Arasaka family in the main line reminds me of Shinji Ikura of EVA. The father-son master-servant relationship in Japanese culture has always been the most favorite carrier in literary works to express people's self-denial.

The hatred of the civilian class towards the company is similar to that of BR2049. Then they can't help but have higher expectations for more big company stories, such as the history of Kangtao Industry and Biotechnology.

The entanglement between V and Ginto is simply "2GhostInShell", double attacking the shell, further concretizing Oshii Mamoru's discussion of the relationship between the spiritual shell and the immortalization at that time.

Night City has a high degree of three-dimensionality, and the over-saturation of information under the cyber setting is very obvious. The host party recommends to wait for the next generation of light chasing to be installed before playing. The visual style is great, and it is in full compliance with the settings, you can see the screenshots.

The technological gap between the branch line and the main line is very large. After all, the development cost is limited, but the basic setting of "high-tech low life" is also skewed. Maybe this is the reason why several other big companies have no role? Here continues to whip the corpse of the Tyrell company in the electronic sheep.

The numerical value and combat system are handled well, it will not over-rpg like UBI, and the degree of freedom is very high. Except for the eyes and hands, the prostheticization doesn't have much novelty in operation, but it is really handsome. The severing system follows the algorithm of Witcher III, which is slightly behind other combat experiences.

There are a lot of bits and pieces of BUG, but Shinobu can continue to play. The details of the game itself are still adequate. For example, the interactive gestures of passers-by playing with the tablet, the control of the steering wheel when driving in a supporting role, etc. are all reasonable, and there are so many branch options, which leads to a huge workload and it is normal to have no time to fix bugs. .

There are many sci-fi side eggs, such as the BB of Death Stranding, the tearsinrain of Blade Runner, etc. The sword in the lake sports car without the Five Virtues of Knights is really expensive.

There is almost everything that this game should have, and the rest is waiting for the patch and DLC. Although this work has steadily accounted for tens of millions of sales, CDPR is now relying on a large amount of overdraft labor, credit and word of mouth, the business model that has been sharpened in five or six years is really worrying that it will be scattered. So let's sell more DLC!
